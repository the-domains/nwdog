Either to custom fit your crate, in the kennel or in your car, we can fit an All Weather Bed to any situation. Pads are waterproof, non-skid rubber on the bottom and 1000D Cordura on the top. All seams are sealed to insure integrity.  Marine grade snaps on one end allow for the stuff to be changed out as needed.

Nothing tests a crate pad better for stains and messes than a handful of rescue puppies.

Sometimes, a pad is for people. Since they Pads and Mats have waterproof bottoms, they make great people seating.
